                <p>Since I joined <strong>Amdocs</strong> I developed my knowledge in computational matters rapidly, by exploiting the in-company tutorials and going through external courses from Amdocs' partners. As a <strong>Software Developer</strong> I deliver back-end solutions focusing mostly on Java and SQL. Amdocs in Cyprus is well known for offering one of the best working environments in the country. The friendly people, the flexible working hours, and the hybrid model together boosted our hype from the very first day until now.</p>

                <p>Serving hundreds of customers per day helped me develop my communication skills. It is vital to reach people with respect and learn how to resolve your customers' problems with patience and calmness. In addition, the working system showed me the importance of team communication to deliver the best possible service.</p>

                <p>Organizing my own events made me realize how difficult and time-consuming it is to start your own business. In these two years, I have managed to introduce my events to hundreds of clients and have worked with many people, bars, and businesses. Experimentation broadened my view of how the world and business in it work, focusing on various aspects such as marketing, leadership, organization, and more.</p>

                <p>Military service was a life-changing experience. I served my country as a reserve officer in the special forces. I went through a lot of drills and training, and then I had the opportunity to lead a team. One of the key concepts that this experience taught me is the importance of living with discipline.</p>
